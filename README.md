# CFR for poker games

This program solves simple poker games by Counterfactual Regret Minimization(CFR)

## Feature


- choose different poker games

- change numbers of iteration and evaluation

- use warm start before training

- add random factor while training

- get average strategy with threshold

- make a figure of exploitability

  note: it will cost much time in Multi-player Leduc Poker because of its large size
